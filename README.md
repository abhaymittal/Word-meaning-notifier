#Word Meaning Script

##Author: Abhay Mittal


This script reads a word line by line from a file provided as $1 starting from line number $2 and then fetches its meaning and some sentences from http://oxforddictionaries.com (American English). It then notifies the user with the meaning and also prints it on the terminal and sleeps for 15 minutes and then moves on to the next word.
